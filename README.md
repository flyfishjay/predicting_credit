# supervised learning --Logistic Regression with Resampling 

This projects goal is to create a logistic regrssion model in order to predict the loan status of a borrower given 
loan  features (such as debt to income interest rates etc).

The analysis uses Logistic regression and supervised learning tools.  Resampling is employed in order
to see the difference between balanced and imbalanced data.
